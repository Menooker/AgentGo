This is a Go AI implement compatible with GTP protocol. The 'master' branch only uses the Monte Carlo method, which is fast and stable. The "uct_WSY_final" branch holds our newest codes which we submited as the final class project. It is much slower but much smarter than the 'master' branch's AI.
Have fun!
